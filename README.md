This is a project for a family member, who has started her own business in Manicure and Facial treatments (Make-up, skin care).

## UX ##
- - - - 
### For what users is this site created ###
Users of the site will be generally more leaning towards women, who are into nail care, and make up art / skin care, and I think they would be between the age of 18 – 60s.

### Why is this site so special? ###
For users and potential customers, to be able to book appointments, look at a gallery of work done previously, generate leads by offering a newsletter for sending discounts to the e-mail, so customers could then book an appointment.

Linking in with Social Media: YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and this way also have an increased brand-awareness, as customers could give reviews on here as well.

If we look at other sites, who offer the same options, sites do not look very inviting. By creating an inviting and elegant website, that’s responsive, build with the idea of mobile first then going towards the desktop, you will set a high standard. And, thus reflecting the idea to your potential customer that you also do deliver such standards in your work.

### Why would a user want this, and why has this site been created ###
A user would want this, as the site will give them access to do the following:
* Read reviews of previous customer
* Look at a gallery of work done previously, and creating an interest in booking an appointment
* Sign up for the available newsletter for potential discounts during the holiday period (i.e. christmas, birthday, you name it)
* Book appointments

### How is my project the best way to achieve this? ###
By providing a website, where the main topic is, __less is more__, I make a responsive site, which will show or build confidence to the visitor. This is done by having high-resolution images, a gallery, testimonials, and well written about me section, where the visitor can get to know the owner and see her certificates, and by being visibile on the internet.

Due to the fact that I know the owner of this business, we work closely together to achieve the best possible outcome, towards both user and site owner. 

By delivering a clean and modern site, for this, I have used a one-page approach. Where customers just scroll from top to bottom.

We will use a tree structure using the burger icon on the top right of the page, the menu will collapse to a fullscreen menu, with large modern font. (coming at a later stage: the burger icon will automatically close if expanded once a link has been clicked / choosen).

### Colour Scheme ###
We have choosen 3 predominant colours.

Main colour #FFBAD2 is choosen as pink. As pink represents femininity, it's also often used to market products to women and young girls.

When you're on the full desktop site, and hover over a link, the link will change style to confirm they are choosing / going to choose that option.

### User Stories ###
* As a potential customer, I want to have an easy overview of what type of treatments I could choose from, so I can make a decission about making an appointment.  
* As a potential customer and visitor to the site, I want to view the gallery, so I can see what type of treatments have been done, and I could decide if I want to make an appointment for a session.  
* As a new visitor to the site, I want the site to be easy to navigate through, so I can find what I was looking for in a quick way.  
* As a potential customer, I want to read previous reviews, so I can see what others have to say to make my decission for booking in an appointment easier.  
* As a potential customer, I would like to read about the store/owner, so I get a better understanding if this is the right fit for myself.  
* As a new visitor and potential on the site, I want the bookings experience, to be easy and understandable.  
* As a new customer, I want to understand the opening hours, and where to go to in case of a booking.
