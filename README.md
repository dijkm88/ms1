# Sarina Nails & Beauty #
- - - - 
This is a project for a family member, who has recently started her own business in Manicure and Facial treatments (Make-up, skin care). She wanted a professional looking website, that would show to her (potential) customers that she's knowledgable, be able to showcase her previous work through a gallery, a source for new customers, a booking page or section, and a link to her social media accounts.  
  
With the creation of this website, we've not only achieved the goal of the client, but exceeded it, by offering her customers and new customers the ability to sign up for her newsletter. The newsletter can be used for special occasions i.e. holiday periods, where people in general want to look at their best, also, when there are new treatments available, or new products that she wants to offer her new and current customers.  
  
## UX ##
- - - - 
### For what users is this site created ###
Users of the site will be generally more leaning towards women, but not limited to, who are into nail care, and make up art / skin care, and would be between the age of 18 – 60s.

### Why is this site so special? ###
For users and potential customers, to be able to book appointments, look at a gallery of work done previously, generate leads by offering a newsletter for sending discounts to the e-mail, so customers could then book an appointment.

Linking in with Social Media: YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and this way also have an increased brand-awareness, as customers could give reviews on here as well.

If we look at other sites, who offer the same options, sites do not look very inviting. By creating an inviting and elegant website, that’s responsive, build with the idea of mobile first then going towards the desktop, you will set a high standard, thus reflecting the idea to your potential customer that you also do deliver such standards in your work.

### Why would a user want this, and why has this site been created ###
A user would want this, as the site will give them access to do the following:
* Read reviews of previous customer
* Look at a gallery of work done previously, and creating an interest in booking an appointment
* Sign up for the available newsletter for potential discounts during the holiday period (i.e. christmas, birthday, you name it)
* Book appointments

### How is my project the best way to achieve this? ###
By providing a website, where the main topic is, __less is more__, I make a responsive site, which will show or build confidence to the visitor and potential customer. This is done by having high-resolution images, a gallery, testimonials in the future, and well written about me section, where the visitor can get to know the owner and see her certification, but most importantly by being visibile on the internet.

Due to the fact that I know the owner of this business, we've worked closely together to achieve the best possible outcome, towards both user and site owner. 

By delivering a clean and modern site, for this, I have used a one-page approach. Where customers just scroll from top to bottom.

We will use a tree structure using the burger icon on the top right of the page, the menu will collapse, with a modern font.

### Colour Scheme ###
We have choosen 3 predominant colours.

![picture alt](assets/readme/site-colours.png "The colours used in the site")

Main colour #FFBAD2 is choosen as pink. As pink represents femininity, it's also often used to market products to women and young girls. Furthermore I've added 2 other accent colours to compliment the pink colour, as seen above.

When you're on the full desktop site, and hover over a link, the link will change style to confirm they are choosing / going to choose that option.

### User Stories ###
* As a potential customer, I want to have an easy overview of what type of treatments I could choose from, so I can make a decission about making an appointment.  
* As a potential customer and visitor to the site, I want to view the gallery, so I can see what type of treatments have been done previously, and I could decide if I want to make an appointment for a session.  
* As a new visitor to the site, I want the site to be easy to navigate, so I can find what I was looking for in an easy way.  
* As a potential customer, I want to read previous reviews, so I can see what others have to say to make my decission for booking in an appointment easier.  
* As a potential customer, I would like to read about the store/owner, so I get a better understanding if this is the right fit for myself.  
* As a new visitor and potential customer on the site, I want the bookings experience, to be easy and understandable.  
* As a new customer, I want to understand the opening / working hours, and where to go to in case of a booking.

## Features ##
- - - - 
The website is created as a one-page design, featuring a navigation bar with a hamburger icon, the Hamburger icon in the navbar, is quite predominantly present, to get the users attention, to be able to move back and forth on the site. It's fully responsive and adapts from mobile to larger screens. In the footer section we have links to the business-owners social media pages. Every section features an introduction heading, and this is done so clear destinction can be made between each section of the page.  
  
__Home__  
  
The home section features a large full screen background, with the business's logo being the predominant image. The background is from one of the owners treatments with a gradient overlay, from pink in the top-left corner to the secundairy colour beige in the right bottom corner, we've made this stand out by incorporating the parallax scrolling effect.  
  
Furthermore it contains the motto of the owner: __"Beauty is confidence directly to your face and nails"__, and an introductory text: __"Welcome to Sarina nails & Beauty"__. Below this, we have 2 buttons, book now and price list. We have kept the home section of the site fairly clean, to have a maximum impact on the visitor with the logo, motto and buttons, and to get the user and (potential) customer to look at the price list and then a direct booking option for returning customers.

The parallax scrolling is removed with a media query, as, some mobile devices like iOS and Android are not capable of processing this feature.  
  
### Features left to implement in future releases ###
* A toggle button for English / Dutch, as the site-owner has her business in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This way, the site is able to be attractive to not only native speaking people from the Netherlands, but also English speaking people who live in the Netherlands, or who search for a nail salon online.
